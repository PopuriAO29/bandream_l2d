PopuriAO29's Notes:

Although I created these texture which I'm using base 005_event_101_story_01, It is too hard to use Live2D software to edit.
Therefore, I don't know what I want going make it.

The reason I had made this with Michelle Head, although it won't fit on Arisa Winter Casual Live2D Texture, so I decided
to use from Happy New-Year Dreams Event base.

To be honest, the idea about this Live2D Model should work following name with:
* arisa_2018af_winter_casual.moc
* arisa_2018af_winter_casual.physics.json

Let me know if you're interested about this Live2D Texture I made, but one of these was made a lot decoration added for Michelle Head.
